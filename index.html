            <h3>ABOUT ME.</h3>
            <div class="half-width">
              <p>I'm a busy Generation Xer who has excelled in a career outside
                of tech, supported a family, raised a child, travelled the
                world, served my country, interacted with people from many
                walks of life, and now manages my own business. On any
                particular day, I have a long to do list.<br><br>I have an
                outsider's healthy skepticism of gimicky tech which detracts
                from the user's productivity, and is seemingly created in a
                vacuum with no input from the potential user. Tech should adapt
                to us and our needs, not the other way around. It should always
                improve a process, not create additional tasks. I allow these
                principles to guide me as I tackle each new computing challenge.

                        <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                        <p>My focus is writing clean, well formatted, semantic
                          HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to
                          read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and
                          accessible.</p>

                        <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                        <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read
                          and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast
                          to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on
                          current best practices.</p>

                        <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly
                          & accurately convert it into a webpage that is a pixel
                          -perfect match.</p>
